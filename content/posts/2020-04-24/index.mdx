Today marks the official launch day of the Big O(omicron) Visualizer on [https://omicron.devillers.nl](https://omicron.devillers.nl).

ðŸ¥‚ Huzzah!

So... what does it do?

In a nutshell, this tool provides a framework for analyzing the performance of algorithms by making it's run time complexity visual in an appealing graph.

Curious to see how such a visualization looks like?

Well, see for yourself: *(best viewed on desktop)*

<ComplexityChart title="Time complexity of sorting algorithms on various lists of numbers">
    <ComplexitySeries/>
    <AnalysisSeries algorithms={Algorithms.all} dataSets={[DataSets.random, DataSets.sorted, DataSets.reversed]} scatter={true}/>
</ComplexityChart>

Nope, that's not a *JPEG*. The image you see above is generated right here inside your browser by running [real sorting algorithms](https://github.com/MartinDevillers/omicron/tree/master/src/algorithms) on [real datasets](https://github.com/MartinDevillers/omicron/blob/master/src/data-sets.ts) and then feeding the results to [a charting library](https://www.highcharts.com/).

Stay tuned as I'll be expanding the content of this website with more content in the next couple of weeks/months.
