Each sorting algorithm now has it's own dedicated page with the following structure:

* **Introduction**. A brief description of the algorithm, it's origin and (in)appropriate use-case. Ok, mostly copy pasta from Wikipedia.
* **Complexity**. An analysis of the time complexity of the algorithm using a variety of experiments and visualizations present in this project.
* **Algorithm**. The source code of the algorithm. Although all these sorting algorithms have been implemented countless of times, there are also many *variations* to these algorithms. For instance, the [Quick Sort](/sorting/quick-sort) algorithm used in this project is an early (naive) implementation that performs worse than modern Quick Sort implementations.

The table-overview of the sorting algorithms has been updated so they link to these pages. Check it out:
