The editor below allows you to create your own visualizations. You can use any of the builtin algorithms and data sets and/or implement your own. The editor will update the visualization with each key stroke. If this slows down your browser too much, uncheck the 'Live mode' option below the editor and use the 'Update chart' button to manually run the analysis and show its output.
